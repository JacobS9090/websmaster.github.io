          <p class="history" id="#company">
                The story of Hippocrates Direct started with an idea at a diner between three college friends. Angus Doctors, Arthur Karrigan, and Jim Harrison all graduated from Stanford in 1991, splintering off into different fields. Angus Doctors became a physician at UCLA's Mattel Children's hospital and opened up a clinic. Arthur Karrigan became an engineer at Yahoo, becoming emersed in the Digitial Revolution of the nineteen-nineties. Jim Harrison became a Financial Analyst for Humana, an insurance provider that covers more than a million lives. As time moved on, the friends would always meet up on the Stanford campus, always meeting at their favorite diner.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
            <p class="history">It was at one of these very meetings that Angus talked about how the new advancements in Technology, Cyber Security, and User Interface have allowed patients to have video conferences with their doctors, often leaving his clinic empty. This sparked a magical conversation between the three friends about starting a website. They would talk about their idea from dinner to dessert, coming up with ideas on designs and features. When Jim asked who the demographic should be towards when they witnessed something commonplace: a senior-citizen struggling to use his new cellphone.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="history">The friends looked at each other and smiled. They knew what they had to do. Because of Arthur's experience as an engineer at Yahoo, he knew how to code the site, but he needed help making the site look clean and revised. Angus used his contacts from UCLA as well as any connections he had while working at his clinic. The first few months of the site were not easy, but after the COVID 19 pandemic, more people began to rely on our site to attend their regularly scheduled appointments. We made sure that the navigation was streamlined and easy enough so that everyone could navigate the site in a time of widespread hardship.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="history">Today, the business has not changed. Jim is currently our head of marketing and sales, using his contacts at other health insurance companies to invest our time with us. Arthur is now the Chief Technology Officer, and he leads his team of engineers to make sure the site runs smoothly. As for me, I am the CEO and president of Hippocrates Direct, making sure that you receive the best care possible.</p>
